# H6 - Predicting the outcome of driving exams in Estonia
Authors: Vanessa Apuhtin & Lisette Pihor

One of The Estonian Transport Administration (ETA)  functions is to conduct practical driving tests for people who want to obtain a driving licence. There are many myths surrounding how or where to do the driving exam. These beliefs create uncertainty and speculation surrounding the driving test process. Our aim is to find features that affect the outcome the most and develop a predicting model.

To access the code you need to have Jupyter Notebook in your computer. There are two seperate code files. H6project.ipynb has the code that modifies the dataset to fit our objectives. H6projectModel.ipynb has the code that generates different models and compares them. CleanedData.csv consist of the modified data and is the result of the first code file. se_2021.csv, se_2022.csv and se_2023.csv are the original datasets. H6_report.pdf has our buisness understanding and data understanding analysis. The two remaining files have figures for understanding the data.

To replicate the same analysis you can use the original data from our repository or download it from https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/datasets/toimunud-soidueksamid-eestis and follow the comments in our code.
